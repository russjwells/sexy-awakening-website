    <p>Sexy Awakening is Earth's first conscious sexuality and connection portal. We believe that relationships are a <b>transformational experience</b> and we exist to facilitate <b>evolutionary connections</b>. We encourage honest <b>up-front communication and radical self-expression</b> on our platform. Sexy Awakening is a place to connect with beings of higher consciousness. A place to express, learn, and play with your sexuality, desires, and social ability. We are a sex positive, inclusive space. We understand sexuality to be fluid, gender as nonbinary, and everyone as sacred.</p>

    <h2>Swipe with Intention</h2>
    <p>Our first game is a lot like something you're already used to: Swiping for matches... but now you choose between sex, love, friendship, and passing. <b>Swipe right for sex, up for romance, left for friendship, and down to pass.</b> If your match swipes on you with the same intention, then voila, you're connected and can <b>begin with a mutual understanding</b>. Otherwise, maybe you'll swipe on them again one day. Enjoy higher consciousness, more fun, and better connections on Sexy Awakening.</p>
    <h2>Membership</h2>
    <p>Sexy Awakening is <b>free to join</b>, but we are offering Sexy Awakening Unlimited membership subscriptions for $11 per month. You get unlimited swiping and the ability to filter out guests. We encourage users who are serious about connecting to subscribe. There is a higher end gold option that comes with a luxurious profile, and there are additional options for those who want to support Sexy Awakening. You are able to filter out users below your tier. You must be 18 or older to join.</p>

    <h2>Repellent</h2>
    <p>Sexy Awakening understands that super-liking a person has nothing to do with meeting people and usually doesn't lead to a good connection, so we don't sell those. We support conscious behavior, so instead, we allow you to <b>buy digital bottles of repellent</b>! Please use it to spray anyone who chooses <b>not to accept your noes</b>, that you sense is acting out of integrity with our service, or is persistantly displaying behavior that is unacceptable to you and persisting in spite of your communication. Sometimes <b>your hard no is</b> what it takes to provide an <b>opportunity for personal growth</b>. We make those fun to deliver. You can also use it if their initial approach was really that lacking. When someone has been sprayed enough <b>everyone else they talk to</b> for a while <b>will know</b>. Eww.</p>
    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>Coming Soon for iOS & Android.</p>
    <p>Know your self, and swipe with intention.</p>
